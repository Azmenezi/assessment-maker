# Database Encryption Guide

## üîê Overview

The Assessment Maker application now includes **comprehensive database encryption** to protect all sensitive data at rest. All sensitive information is encrypted using industry-standard AES-256-CBC encryption before being stored in the SQLite database.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Encryption Algorithm

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-CBC (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Key Size**: 256 bits
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 10,000 iterations
- **Salt Size**: 256 bits (unique per encryption)
- **IV Size**: 128 bits (unique per encryption)
- **Padding**: PKCS7

### Security Benefits

- **Data at Rest Protection**: All sensitive data is encrypted in the database
- **Key Management**: Secure key generation and storage
- **Salt & IV**: Unique salt and initialization vector for each encryption operation
- **Forward Secrecy**: Each piece of data has its own encryption parameters
- **Transparent Operation**: Encryption/decryption happens automatically

## üìä Encrypted Data Types

### Reports Table

The following fields are encrypted in the reports table:

- `project_name` - Project/client names
- `assessor_name` - Assessor personal information
- `platform` - Target platform details
- `urls` - Target URLs and endpoints
- `credentials` - Authentication credentials
- `ticket_number` - Internal ticket/tracking numbers
- `build_versions` - Version information
- `requested_by` - Requesting party information
- `executive_summary` - Executive summary content
- `scope` - Assessment scope details
- `methodology` - Testing methodology
- `conclusion` - Assessment conclusions
- `parent_assessment_data` - Historical assessment data

### Findings Table

The following fields are encrypted in the findings table:

- `title` - Finding titles
- `description` - Detailed finding descriptions
- `impact` - Impact assessments
- `mitigation` - Mitigation recommendations
- `affected_endpoints` - Affected system endpoints

### Images Table

The following fields are encrypted in the images table:

- `filename` - Generated filenames
- `original_name` - Original uploaded filenames
- `image_data` - Complete image BLOB data (binary encryption)

### Non-Encrypted Fields

These fields remain unencrypted for performance and functionality:

- Primary keys and foreign keys
- Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
- Enumerated values (severity, category, status)
- Version numbers
- Assessment types
- MIME types and file sizes

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Encryption Process

1. **Key Derivation**: Master key + unique salt ‚Üí derived key (PBKDF2)
2. **IV Generation**: Random 128-bit initialization vector
3. **Encryption**: AES-256-CBC with PKCS7 padding
4. **Storage Format**: `ENC:base64(salt:iv:encrypted_data)`

### Decryption Process

1. **Format Validation**: Check for `ENC:` prefix
2. **Data Parsing**: Extract salt, IV, and encrypted data
3. **Key Derivation**: Recreate derived key using salt
4. **Decryption**: AES-256-CBC decryption with same parameters

### Image Encryption

Images receive special handling:

- Binary data converted to base64 for encryption
- Encrypted as text using same AES-256-CBC process
- Stored as encrypted BLOB in database
- Automatically decrypted when retrieved

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Automatic Setup

The encryption system initializes automatically when the server starts:

```bash
npm run server
```

### Key Generation

On first run, the system will:

1. Generate a secure 256-bit master key
2. Save it to `server/.encryption_key` (restricted permissions)
3. Display confirmation message: "üîê New encryption key generated and saved"

### Existing Installations

For existing databases:

1. New data will be encrypted automatically
2. Existing unencrypted data remains readable
3. Data is encrypted when updated/modified
4. Use migration tools to encrypt existing data in bulk

## üìã Monitoring & Status

### Encryption Status Endpoint

Check encryption status via API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/encryption/status
```

Response includes:

- Encryption status (enabled/disabled)
- Algorithm details
- Test results
- List of encrypted fields
- Configuration parameters

### Server Logs

Monitor encryption activity in server logs:

- Key loading confirmation
- Encryption test results
- Error messages (if any)

## üîë Key Management

### Key Location

- **File**: `server/.encryption_key`
- **Permissions**: 600 (owner read/write only)
- **Format**: Hexadecimal string

### Key Security

- **Generation**: Cryptographically secure random generation
- **Storage**: File system with restricted permissions
- **Access**: Only server process can read
- **Backup**: Include in secure backup procedures

### Key Rotation (Advanced)

For key rotation:

1. Stop the server
2. Backup the database
3. Export all data (decrypted)
4. Delete the old key file
5. Start server (generates new key)
6. Re-import data (encrypted with new key)

## üõ†Ô∏è Migration & Compatibility

### Data Migration

Existing data can be migrated to encrypted format:

```bash
# Export existing data
node server/migrate.js export

# Data will be automatically encrypted on import
node server/migrate.js import backup.json
```

### Backward Compatibility

- Unencrypted data is automatically detected
- Mixed encrypted/unencrypted data is supported
- Gradual migration possible without downtime

## üîç Verification

### Database Inspection

Verify encryption in raw database:

```bash
sqlite3 server/assessment_maker.db "SELECT project_name FROM reports LIMIT 1;"
```

Should show encrypted format: `ENC:base64data...`

### API Testing

Verify decryption via API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/reports | jq '.[0].projectName'
```

Should show decrypted, readable data.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

### Do Not Lose the Key

- **Critical**: The encryption key is required to decrypt data
- **Backup**: Include the key file in secure backups
- **Recovery**: Lost keys = permanently inaccessible data

### Production Deployment

- Ensure key file has proper permissions (600)
- Include key in secure backup procedures
- Consider key management systems for enterprise use
- Monitor encryption status endpoint

### Performance Considerations

- Encryption adds minimal overhead (~5-10ms per operation)
- Database size may increase slightly due to encryption metadata
- Query performance unaffected (encrypted fields not indexed)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server won't start - encryption error**

- Check if crypto-js is installed: `npm install crypto-js`
- Verify key file permissions
- Check server logs for specific error

**Data appears corrupted**

- Verify encryption key hasn't changed
- Check for filesystem issues
- Use encryption status endpoint to test

**Performance issues**

- Monitor server resources
- Consider database optimization
- Check for excessive encryption/decryption operations

### Support Commands

```bash
# Check encryption status
curl http://localhost:3001/api/encryption/status

# Test server health
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# View server logs
npm run server

# Database backup
node server/migrate.js export
```
